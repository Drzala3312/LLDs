## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Requirement
- A building can have many floors and elevators
- Elevator can have max 8 person or 1680Kg
- Ground Floor doesn't have down button
- Top floor doesn't have up button
- Elevator has 3 stats up down and ideal
- Elevator open only when state is ideal
- Display screen in floor and elevator

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
